# Magnetocardiography-Detection-and-Source-Localization
This work presents a novel approach to cardiac magnetic field detection and source localization using magnetoimpedance sensors. The research demonstrates the ability to detect and localize multiple cardiac sources in controlled environmental conditions, offering a potential alternative to traditional SQUID-based magnetocardiography systems.
